Cppcheck - A tool for static C/C++ code analysis

Syntax:
    cppcheck [OPTIONS] [files or paths]

If a directory is given instead of a filename, *.cpp, *.cxx, *.cc, *.c++, *.c,
*.tpp, and *.txx files are checked recursively from the given directory.

Options:
    --append=<file>      This allows you to provide information about functions
                         by providing an implementation for them.
    --check-config       Check cppcheck configuration. The normal code
                         analysis is disabled by this flag.
    --check-library      Show information messages when library files have
                         incomplete info.
    -D<ID>               Define preprocessor symbol. Unless --max-configs or
                         --force is used, Cppcheck will only check the given
                         configuration when -D is used.
                         Example: '-DDEBUG=1 -D__cplusplus'.
    -U<ID>               Undefine preprocessor symbol. Use -U to explicitly
                         hide certain #ifdef <ID> code paths from checking.
                         Example: '-UDEBUG'
    --enable=<id>        Enable additional checks. The available ids are:
                          * all
                                  Enable all checks. It is recommended to only
                                  use --enable=all when the whole program is
                                  scanned, because this enables unusedFunction.
                          * warning
                                  Enable warning messages
                          * style
                                  Enable all coding style checks. All messages
                                  with the severities 'style', 'performance' and
                                  'portability' are enabled.
                          * performance
                                  Enable performance messages
                          * portability
                                  Enable portability messages
                          * information
                                  Enable information messages
                          * unusedFunction
                                  Check for unused functions. It is recommend
                                  to only enable this when the whole program is
                                  scanned.
                          * missingInclude
                                  Warn if there are missing includes. For
                                  detailed information, use '--check-config'.
                         Several ids can be given if you separate them with
                         commas. See also --std
    --error-exitcode=<n> If errors are found, integer [n] is returned instead of
                         the default '0'. '1' is returned
                         if arguments are not valid or if no input files are
                         provided. Note that your operating system can modify
                         this value, e.g. '256' can become '0'.
    --errorlist          Print a list of all the error messages in XML format.
    --exitcode-suppressions=<file>
                         Used when certain messages should be displayed but
                         should not cause a non-zero exitcode.
    --file-list=<file>   Specify the files to check in a text file. Add one
                         filename per line. When file is '-,' the file list will
                         be read from standard input.
    -f, --force          Force checking of all configurations in files. If used
                         together with '--max-configs=', the last option is the
                         one that is effective.
    -h, --help           Print this help.
    -I <dir>             Give path to search for include files. Give several -I
                         parameters to give several paths. First given path is
                         searched for contained header files first. If paths are
                         relative to source files, this is not needed.
    --includes-file=<file>
                         Specify directory paths to search for included header
                         files in a text file. Add one include path per line.
                         First given path is searched for contained header
                         files first. If paths are relative to source files,
                         this is not needed.
    --include=<file>
                         Force inclusion of a file before the checked file. Can
                         be used for example when checking the Linux kernel,
                         where autoconf.h needs to be included for every file
                         compiled. Works the same way as the GCC -include
                         option.
    -i <dir or file>     Give a source file or source file directory to exclude
                         from the check. This applies only to source files so
                         header files included by source files are not matched.
                         Directory name is matched to all parts of the path.
    --inconclusive       Allow that Cppcheck reports even though the analysis is
                         inconclusive.
                         There are false positives with this option. Each result
                         must be carefully investigated before you know if it is
                         good or bad.
    --inline-suppr       Enable inline suppressions. Use them by placing one or
                         more comments, like: '// cppcheck-suppress warningId'
                         on the lines before the warning to suppress.
    -j <jobs>            Start [jobs] threads to do the checking simultaneously.
    --language=<language>, -x <language>
                         Forces cppcheck to check all files as the given
                         language. Valid values are: c, c++
    --library=<cfg>
                         Use library configuration.
    --max-configs=<limit>
                         Maximum number of configurations to check in a file
                         before skipping it. Default is '12'. If used together
                         with '--force', the last option is the one that is
                         effective.
    --platform=<type>    Specifies platform specific types and sizes. The
                         available platforms are:
                          * unix32
                                 32 bit unix variant
                          * unix64
                                 64 bit unix variant
                          * win32A
                                 32 bit Windows ASCII character encoding
                          * win32W
                                 32 bit Windows UNICODE character encoding
                          * win64
                                 64 bit Windows
    -q, --quiet          Only print error messages.
    -rp, --relative-paths
    -rp=<paths>, --relative-paths=<paths>
                         Use relative paths in output. When given, <paths> are
                         used as base. You can separate multiple paths by ';'.
                         Otherwise path where source files are searched is used.
                         We use string comparison to create relative paths, so
                         using e.g. ~ for home folder does not work. It is
                         currently only possible to apply the base paths to
                         files that are on a lower level in the directory tree.
    --report-progress    Report progress messages while checking a file.
    --std=<id>           Set standard.
                         The available options are:
                          * posix
                                 POSIX compatible code
                          * c89
                                 C code is C89 compatible
                          * c99
                                 C code is C99 compatible
                          * c11
                                 C code is C11 compatible (default)
                          * c++03
                                 C++ code is C++03 compatible
                          * c++11
                                 C++ code is C++11 compatible (default)
                         More than one --std can be used:
                           'cppcheck --std=c99 --std=posix file.c'
    --suppress=<spec>    Suppress warnings that match <spec>. The format of
                         <spec> is:
                         [error id]:[filename]:[line]
                         The [filename] and [line] are optional. If [error id]
                         is a wildcard '*', all error ids match.
    --suppressions-list=<file>
                         Suppress warnings listed in the file. Each suppression
                         is in the same format as <spec> above.
    --template='<text>'  Format the error messages. E.g.
                         '{file}:{line},{severity},{id},{message}' or
                         '{file}({line}):({severity}) {message}' or
                         '{callstack} {message}'
                         Pre-defined templates: gcc, vs, edit.
    -v, --verbose        Output more detailed error information.
    --version            Print out version number.
    --xml                Write results in xml format to error stream (stderr).
    --xml-version=<version>
                         Select the XML file version. Currently versions 1 and
                         2 are available. The default version is 1.
Example usage:
  # Recursively check the current folder. Print the progress on the screen and
  # write errors to a file:
  cppcheck . 2> err.txt

  # Recursively check ../myproject/ and don't print progress:
  cppcheck --quiet ../myproject/

  # Check test.cpp, enable all checks:
  cppcheck --enable=all --inconclusive --std=posix test.cpp

  # Check f.cpp and search include files from inc1/ and inc2/:
  cppcheck -I inc1/ -I inc2/ f.cpp
